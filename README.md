Overview: For the resurrection of this project I will be attempting to implement a level system that adds in new types of aliens when the player reaches a specific level.
ex. reaching level 5 introduces the new alien type octopus

Pseudocode:
initialize new integer variable for level count
implement level increase count after every level clear
write function to change alien type
when level count = 5, 10, 15 adds new alien type
